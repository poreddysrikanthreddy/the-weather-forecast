Technologies that we will use for this project are JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, luxon, unicons. It is going to be amazing to work on this build. We will fetch data from OpenWeather endpoints. We will be getting temperature, max, min, humidity, real feel, sunrise, sunset, hourly, and daily forecast. We will also display the local time at the selected location. For input, there are some quick links on top along with a text box for searching a city and also a current location-based sea.
